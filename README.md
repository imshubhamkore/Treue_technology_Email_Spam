Email spam detection
 
One of the primary methods for spam mail detection is email filtering. It involves categorizing incoming emails into spam and non-spam. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to filter out spam mail based on its content and metadata.

DESCRIPTION

• The project code completely done using Python

Treue Technology provided the data set.

• Pandas, re, nltk, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib, tqdm, and time are necessary packages to have installed.

• The operations performed include data preprocessing, NLP, classification, and classification reporting.

• For this project, a classification model that achieves high accuracy for text data generated by NLP operations was based on logistic regression.

• Using a heatmap to visualize the confusion matrix to clearly see how the classification model is performing.

• A classification report has been completed, in the end.

Other Important Steps in Detecting Spam Mail:

• Email Filtering: One of the primary methods for spam mail detection is email filtering. It entails classifying incoming emails as spam or not. On the basis of the content and metadata of the emails, machine learning algorithms can be trained to identify spam.

• Natural Language Processing (NLP): This method enables machines to comprehend and process human language. Because it helps with the extraction of useful information from emails' subject, body, and attachments, it is crucial to the process of identifying spam.

• Text Classification: A supervised learning technique for spam detection, text classification. It involves classifying emails as spam or not spam based on certain characteristics, such as the use of particular keywords, tone, or grammar.

• Feature engineering: The process of selecting pertinent features from an email in order to categorize it as spam or not. It entails extracting details like the email address of the sender, the presence of particular words or phrases, and the email's length.

• Supervised learning: Using labelled data to train a model to predict the labels of new, unlabeled data is known as supervised learning. It is widely used in spam detection for text classification tasks.

Evaluation:
The performance of the NLP model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Evaluation results are logged during training and can be found in the training script output.

• Unsupervised Learning: Unsupervised learning is a technique used to find hidden patterns in the data without the need for labelled data. It can be used for anomaly detection, clustering, and association rule mining.

• Deep Learning: Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that involves training deep neural networks with multiple hidden layers to learn complex features from the data. It has shown great promise in spam detection tasks.

• Neural Networks: Neural networks are a type of deep learning model inspired by the human brain. They can be trained to extract meaningful features from emails and classify them as spam or non-spam.
